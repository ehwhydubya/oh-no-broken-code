## Oh No! Broken Code!

This repository has a few files that need a small amount of love. Can you fix the errors and add the missing code?

Difficulty Order:

* `icecream.py` (lists)
* `birthday.py` (dictionaries, if)
* `keyboard.py` (indentation)
* `github.py` (finding a key in a json file)
* `halloween.py` (random, lists, input, if)
* `vacation.py` (functions, returns, dictionaries)

### Getting Started

You are going to create your own copy of this code, a process called [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

First of all, **fork** the repository. Hit the 'Fork' button in the top right corner.

Once you have forked it, you will have your own copy under your own GitHub account!

Go to that copy and **clone** the repository to a local folder.

At the right of the page you will see a section called "HTTPS clone URL". Copy that URL and in a Terminal window, go to your projects folder (or wherever) and clone the repo:

```
cd projects
git clone [PASTE HERE]
```

Now you should have a new directory called `oh-no-broken-code`:

```
cd oh-no-broken-code
ls
```

When you are done making changes to your files, **commit** and **push** them back to your GitHub repo!

```
git add *.py
git commit -m "I fixed all the bugz"
git push origin master
```
